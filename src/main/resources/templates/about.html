            <p style="margin: 0;">&emsp;Projects: Theater project Spring boot</p>
            The project is an interactive theater: during the show, viewers can choose one or another plot development, giving their votes for the option they like. The project was over a year old. Most of the team is from Ukraine.
            <p style="margin: 0;">&emsp; Responsibilities: Development of new improvements, as well as correction of existing bugs.

            <p style="margin: 0;">&emsp;In 2020, I started to improve my Java programming. During the Java Advanced
                course at the Academy of IT Clusters, my colleague and I developed an interactive conference assistant
                program, which I deployed in the Azure cloud service.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0ch">Project description: The essence of the project was to create a Spring Boot web
                application that will ask questions, view already asked questions and increase the rating of already
                asked questions at conferences with a large audience, where questions are difficult to hear from the
                speaker or other listeners without additional equipment. dynamics). The administrative part was
                entrusted to me.</p>
            <p>&emsp;In early 2020, I decided to write a bot telegram to simplify the search for Stihl products for
                buyers and sellers of the store where I work. This bot combines the ability to quickly find current
                prices for goods. The bot also knows how to search for a product by name and searches for a list of
                similar products, and if necessary, calculates a discount. This bot inspired me to improve my Java
                programming skill.</p>
            <p>&emsp;In 2019, I started learning Java at the Academy of IT Clusters, worked with IDEA and GIT, where I
                wrote my first project. The idea of the project was to create private and public chat rooms. I also
                studied SQL and Java courses at Sololearn.</p>
            <p>&emsp;In 2012, I worked as a system administrator at Ivano-Frankivsk University of Oil and Gas. My
                responsibilities included troubleshooting the computer system, installing and configuring new hardware
                and software.</p>
